## Online Discussion Area
I have setup an online discussion board on slack.com for usage in this class. If you decide to work on a group project, I can create some private channels for you to work on, but I want to be able to participate in your conversations - so please use the space on slack.

Go to [drhale8470.slack.com](https://drhale8470.slack.com) and use your unomaha email address to register an account. Alternatively, you can use [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/drhale8470/shared_invite/enQtNDI1Nzk4MDY3MDEwLTAyNDk5NTYzZWQ5M2RiOTZkNmFlYTJlN2NmZDYyMjQxNTk0Yjg3MjM5Mjk0MzNlZWY1YjZlODljYjI4ZjVjYTI).This will give you access to the class slack channel. The chat channel is for general discussions with me or your fellow classmates. The questions channel is for you to ask public questions that I will answer for the whole class. This is better than email if you think that the answer to your question might benefit everyone. You can also send me private messages. Generally I am faster at replying on slack than I am by email.
